Probably need to break things up a bit.
Make a probabilities class, with an update method. 

allow me to choose at run-time if replacement. 

Current simulates a single reaction. Add more than one reaction.

As of revision 20, the obvious outstanding problem is that the probabilities 
seem to change in steps, rather than continuously. this might be a precision
problem.

Figure out a way to script several runs.
