Probably need to break things up a bit.
Make a probabilities class, with an update method. 

allow me to choose at run-time if replacement. 

Current simulates a single reaction. Add more than one reaction.

As of revision 20, the obvious outstanding problem is that the probabilities 
seem to change in steps, rather than continuously. This could partially be 
aliasing between the chain probability and the chain number, but that's not
the whole story. For 1 2 3, for example, p_a seems to only take the values 
3/5, 4/6, 5/7, ... n/(n+2). Maybe some LCM/GCD interaction.


Ultimate goal for validation: reproduce figures 5.1 and 5.2 on p 126 of 
Cowis and Arrighi

The alternating polymer sometimes fails the assert at the end.
