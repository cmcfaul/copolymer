Probably need to break things up a bit.
Make a probabilities class, with an update method. 

allow me to choose at run-time if replacement. 

Current simulates a single reaction. Add more than one reaction.

As of revision 20, the obvious outstanding problem is that the probabilities 
seem to change in steps, rather than continuously. this is not a precision
problem.

Figure out a way to script several runs. 

Ultimate goal for validation: reproduce figures 5.1 and 5.2 on p 126 of 
Cowis and Arrighi
