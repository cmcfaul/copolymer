check the histograms of the simulations i've done; make sure the extermal compositions are not hitting the edges of possibility.

My first pass is NOT a first-order markov; it is just a binomial with the probabilities calculated from the rr's. I probably want that for comparison to the proper markov.

Incorporate the one-step memory. i might be able to use the unconditional probabilities to compute the conditional probabilities.
I think all I have to do is use p_a and p_b to get p_ab, etc, and use those
to generate p(a,b) = p(AB)/p(A), etc.
